"""Progressive reference snippets — injected into context based on agent state.

Inspired by text-to-cad's progressive documentation pattern, adapted for
CADRIG's code-side injection approach. Instead of relying on the LLM to
load reference docs on demand, _build_context() in loop.py injects these
snippets automatically based on the current agent state (iteration, quality
results, error history).

Each snippet is kept under ~300 tokens to avoid blowing the 24K context budget.

FIRST EXECUTION CHECKLIST:
- Use cq.Workplane("XY") to start — do NOT import cadquery.
- cylinder(H, R) — HEIGHT first, RADIUS second.
- translate((x, y, z)) takes a TUPLE, not separate arguments.
- For fuse/union: shapes MUST physically overlap by ≥0.5mm.
- cq_show(result, "Label") is required to display shapes.

#: Injected when quality gate fails — specific repair guidance per failure code.
#: Each line maps a QualityIssue.code to a concrete fix.
REF_QUALITY_FAILURE = """
QUALITY REPAIR GUIDANCE (based on last failure):
- NO_SOLID: Use solid primitives (box, cylinder, sphere) not open wires/shells.
  Ensure extrude(H) has H > 0 and profile is closed.
- MULTI_SOLID: Shapes must OVERLAP physically for union to merge. Extend one
  shape INTO the other by at least 0.5mm before calling .union().
- COMPOUND_SHAPE: Extract the solid first: shape = shape.Solids[0] before
  boolean operations.
- INVALID_SHAPE: Boolean operation produced invalid geometry. Simplify or
  change the construction order. Try smaller overlap.
- NEGATIVE_VOLUME: Inside-out geometry. Reverse construction order.
- DIMENSION_SUSPICIOUS: Check for unit errors (mm assumed). Verify your
  dimensions match requirements.
"""

#: Injected when errors repeat — structured repair loop strategy.
REF_REPAIR_LOOP = """
REPAIR STRATEGY — you have repeated errors, change your approach:
1. Identify the ROOT CAUSE, not just the symptom.
2. Change ONE thing at a time (overlap distance, boolean order, geometry type).
3. If boolean fails: try increasing overlap, or use a different construction
   method (e.g., make_box_handle instead of manual torus+box positioning).
4. If 3+ failures on same shape: use undo_last and try a completely different
   construction approach.
5. Consider building a simpler version first, then adding complexity.

REF_ITERATION_URGENCY = """
WARNING: You are approaching the iteration limit ({max_iter} max, currently
{current}). Focus on producing a valid solid — simplify if needed. Prioritize
correct geometry over feature completeness.

REF_QUALITY_PASSED_WARN = """
Quality check PASSED with warnings. The model is valid but may have issues.
Review warnings above. You may continue adding features or fix warnings.
